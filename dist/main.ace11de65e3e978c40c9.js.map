Here an example to fulfill a promsise, this time with only one argument: \n *         promise(true, [42]);\n *\n * When the promise has been rejected, call it with false. Again, there may be more than one argument for the then() handler:\n *         promise(true, [6, 6, 6]);\n *         \n * You can obtain the promise's current state by calling the function without arguments. It will be true if fulfilled,\n * false if rejected, and otherwise undefined.\n * \t\t   var state = promise(); \n * \n * https://github.com/timjansen/PinkySwear.js\n */\n(function(target) {\n\tvar undef;\n\n\tfunction isFunction(f) {\n\t\treturn typeof f == 'function';\n\t}\n\tfunction isObject(f) {\n\t\treturn typeof f == 'object';\n\t}\n\tfunction defer(callback) {\n\t\tif (typeof setImmediate != 'undefined')\n\t\t\tsetImmediate(callback);\n\t\telse if (typeof process != 'undefined' && process['nextTick'])\n\t\t\tprocess['nextTick'](callback);\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(callback, 0);\n\t}\n\n\ttarget[0][target[1]] = function pinkySwear(extend) {\n\t\tvar state;           // undefined/null = pending, true = fulfilled, false = rejected\n\t\tvar values = [];     // an array of values as arguments for the then() handlers\n\t\tvar deferred = [];   // functions to call when set() is invoked\n\n\t\tvar set = function(newState, newValues) {\n\t\t\tif (state == null && newState != null) {\n\t\t\t\tstate = newState;\n\t\t\t\tvalues = newValues;\n\t\t\t\tif (deferred.length)\n\t\t\t\t\tdefer(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var i = 0; i < deferred.length; i++)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeferred[i]();\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn state;\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tset['then'] = function (onFulfilled, onRejected) {\n\t\t\tvar promise2 = pinkySwear(extend);\n\t\t\tvar callCallbacks = function() {\n\t    \t\ttry {\n\t    \t\t\tvar f = (state ? onFulfilled : onRejected);\n\t    \t\t\tif (isFunction(f)) {\n\t\t   \t\t\t\tfunction resolve(x) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    var then, cbCalled = 0;\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tif (x && (isObject(x) || isFunction(x)) && isFunction(then = x['then'])) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (x === promise2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow new TypeError();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthen['call'](x,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction() { if (!cbCalled++) resolve.apply(undef,arguments); } ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfunction(value){ if (!cbCalled++) promise2(false,[value]);});\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t\tpromise2(true, arguments);\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\tcatch(e) {\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\tif (!cbCalled++)\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\tpromise2(false, [e]);\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t}\n\t\t   \t\t\t\tresolve(f.apply(undef, values || []));\n\t\t   \t\t\t}\n\t\t   \t\t\telse\n\t\t   \t\t\t\tpromise2(state, values);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tcatch (e) {\n\t\t\t\t\tpromise2(false, [e]);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\tif (state != null)\n\t\t\t\tdefer(callCallbacks);\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\tdeferred.push(callCallbacks);\n\t\t\treturn promise2;\n\t\t};\n        if(extend){\n            set = extend(set);\n        }\n\t\treturn set;\n\t};\n})(typeof module == 'undefined' ?
